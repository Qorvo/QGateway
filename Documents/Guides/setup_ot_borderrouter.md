# Setup OpenThread Border Router on Qorvo's QPG7015M Gateway development kit

In this guide, step by step instructions are given to setup an OpenThread Border Router, using Qorvo's QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit.
This enables the user to set up a Matter network and control Matter devices over Wi-Fi/ethernet with the QPG7015M operating as an OpenThread Border Router, using the [Android chip-tool](https://github.com/Qorvo/QMatter/blob/v0.7.1.0/Documents/Guides/commissioning_android_chiptool.md), or the [POSIX CLI chip-tool](https://github.com/Qorvo/QMatter/blob/v0.7.1.0/Documents/Guides/commissioning_posix_cli_chiptool.md).

Required Hardware:
- Access point/Router to connect your QPG7015M Gateway development kit to a local area network (LAN).
- Qorvo's QPG7015M Gateway development kit:

## Step 1: Establish access to the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit

Described in the section "[Accessing the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit's terminal](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#accessing-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kits-terminal)" of the QPG7015M Gateway DK Setup guide.

## Step 2: Configure the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit for OpenThread Border Router

How to edit the configuration file is described in the section "[Configure the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#configure-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kit)" of the QPG7015M Gateway DK Setup guide.
In [Stack configuration](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#stack-configuration) disable the unwanted stacks and enable following parameters:

```shell
QORVO_OT_BR=1
QORVO_OT_BRBB_INTERFACE=wlan0
```

## Step 3: Start the OpenThread Border Router

Now the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit, must be started to run with the configuration set in [Step 2](#step-2-configure-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kit-for-openthread-border-router).
This is described in the section "[Start the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#start-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kit)" of the QPG7015M Gateway DK Setup guide.
Make sure you see following logging:

```shell

Loading ot-br docker image from file!
3a7cc06ad581: Loading layer [==================================================>]  48.07MB/48.07MB
57fa7918522d: Loading layer [==================================================>]  81.91MB/81.91MB

Gateway does not start automatically at boot

-------

Docker container otbr_docker_0 is running and Up 6 seconds.

You can now start ot-ctl command-line utility, and get logs by entering the following commands:

docker exec -it otbr_docker_0 ot-ctl
docker logs otbr_docker_0

-------
GATEWAY STARTED AND READY TO USE!

```

The OpenThread Border Router launches a Wi-Fi Access Point `BorderRouter-AP` with password `Qorvo_QPG7015M`. The user is now able to access the OpenThread Border Router via its IP address or hostname on a device that's connected to that Wi-Fi Access point. Matter devices can be joined to the network using the [Android chip-tool](https://github.com/Qorvo/QMatter/blob/v0.7.1.0/Documents/Guides/commissioning_android_chiptool.md) or the [POSIX CLI chip-tool](https://github.com/Qorvo/QMatter/blob/v0.7.1.0/Documents/Guides/commissioning_posix_cli_chiptool.md).

## Step 4: Stop the OpenThread Border Router

This is described in the section "[Stop the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#stop-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kit)" of the QPG7015M Gateway DK Setup guide.
Stopping the DK will **NOT** delete the info of the joined devices.

## Step 5: Factory reset the OpenThread Border Router

This is described in the section "[Factory reset the QPG7015M Gateway Development Kit](./setup_qpg7015m_dk.md#factory-reset-the-qpg7015m-gateway-development-kit)" of the QPG7015M Gateway DK Setup guide.
This action **WILL** delete the info of all joined devices.
Pay attention to following logging:

```shell
pi@[hostname]:~ $ ./factory_reset_gateway.sh 
FACTORY RESETTING GATEWAY...
STOPPING GATEWAY...
